# Legal AI Toolkit

This project is a web-based "Legal AI Toolkit" designed as a final year project for a B.Sc. (Data Science) and LL.B. (Hons) program. It integrates three core legal tech tools into a single, user-friendly interface to demonstrate the practical application of AI in the legal field.

## ‚ú® Features

This toolkit includes three main components:

1.  **Intelligent Clause Extractor:** Paste the text of a contract, and the tool uses AI to identify, extract, and summarize key clauses such as Limitation of Liability, Confidentiality, and Governing Law.
2.  **Contract Version Comparison:** Upload two versions of a contract, and the tool provides a "diff" style comparison, clearly highlighting what has been added, removed, or changed between the documents.
3.  **Basic Contract Generation Assistant:** Generate a basic draft for common legal documents (like a Non-Disclosure Agreement) by providing key details. The tool creates a template with placeholders for customization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **AI/LLM:** Google Gemini API
